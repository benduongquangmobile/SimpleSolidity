# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

For testing

<b>Run test ting with title includes </b>
<br/>
```yarn hardhat test --grep some_title_testing_it```

<b>Check file and line didn't test solidity-coverage</b>
<br/>
```yarn hardhat coverage```

<b>Generate type using typechain-types
```yarn hardhat typechain```
